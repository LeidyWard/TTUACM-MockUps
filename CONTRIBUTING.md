### Design Patterns
- We are currently using Material Design. We also require knowledge of using Adobe XD to create mockups.
- Please use `material-components.xd` generously.
- Prefer `.svg` and other vector files over `.jpg`

### Naming Coventions
- Use capital snake-case when naming assets and be descriptive with the name of the files
- Examples


    Foo_Bar_Illustration.jpg

    Foo_Bar_Logo.svg

    Foo_Bar_Icon_1.svg

    Foo_Bar_Icon_2.svg
